    <p>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
      Now is the time that face should form another;
      Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
      Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</p>
      
     <p>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
      Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
      Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
      Of his self-love, to stop posterity?</p>
      
      <p>Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
      Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
      So thou through windows of thine age shall see
      Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</p>
